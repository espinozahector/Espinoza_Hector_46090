Welcome to the game of 21, based on the popular card game.
How to play: The objective of the game is to get the highest total without exceeding 21.
Each player has an independent game against the dealer and the objective is to beat the dealer.
If the players hand total is higher then 21, it is called a bust, and the dealer wins.
Even if both the player and the dealer have a bust as well.
A 21 hand is calculated as follows: Cards of 2-10 are worth their face value.
Jack, Queen, King are also worth 10 each.
The Ace card is worth 11 unless it causes the player to bust his hand, which in this case the Ace can be counted as a 1.
A two cards hand with the ace and a 10 value is called blackjack and it is a winning hand,
unless the dealer has an Ace and a 10 value, in this case is a bust.
